# Version History

## Version 1.2.19 - Project Deletion Fix
**Release Date**: October 7, 2025

### Critical Bug Fixes
1. **Incomplete Project Deletion**
   - Fixed a critical bug where deleting a project did not delete the associated dictionaries from MongoDB.
   - Now, when a project is deleted, all its dictionary versions are also removed from MongoDB.

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/apps/backend/api/v1/projects.py`: Updated the `delete_project` endpoint to include logic for deleting MongoDB documents.
- **Deletion Flow**:
  1. Fetches all `mongo_id`s for the project from the `dictionary_versions` table in Supabase.
  2. Deletes all corresponding documents from the `dictionaries` collection in MongoDB.
  3. Deletes the project from the `projects` table in Supabase, which cascades to `dictionary_versions`.

### Impact
- ✅ Prevents orphaned data in MongoDB.
- ✅ Ensures data consistency between Supabase and MongoDB.
- ✅ Improves data integrity and cleanup.

## Version 1.2.18 - MongoDB Schema Structure Fix for Dictionary Creation
**Release Date**: October 5, 2025

### Critical Bug Fixes
1. **MongoDB Schema Validation Error**
   - Fixed document validation failures when creating dictionary versions
   - Error: `Document failed validation` with missing required fields
   - Root cause: Incorrect schema structure in MongoDB documents

2. **Schema Structure Standardization**
   - Changed `schemas` field from single object to structured format:
     - Old: `schemas: { name: "public", tables: [...] }`
     - New: `schemas: { tables: [...], relationships: [] }`
   - All tables now stored in flat array with `schema_name` property
   - Simplified schema management and queries

3. **ERD Structure Requirements**
   - Fixed missing `nodes` and `edges` in ERD field
   - ERD now properly initialized with required structure:
     ```json
     {
       "nodes": [],
       "edges": []
     }
     ```

4. **Column Type Field**
   - Ensured all columns have required `type` field
   - Fixed validation error: `missingProperties: ['type']`

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/apps/backend/api/v1/projects.py`: Fixed initial dictionary creation
  - `/apps/backend/api/v1/versions.py`: Fixed version creation and update logic
  - `/apps/backend/api/v1/tables.py`: Updated table CRUD operations for new schema structure

- **Schema Changes**:
  - `schemas` field structure: `{ tables: [], relationships: [] }`
  - Each table includes `schema_name` property for filtering
  - ERD field always includes `nodes` and `edges` arrays
  - Relationships stored at root level and in schemas for compatibility

- **Backward Compatibility**:
  - Code handles both old and new schema formats
  - Graceful migration path for existing data
  - No breaking changes to API endpoints

### Impact
- ✅ New projects can be created without validation errors
- ✅ Dictionary versions save successfully to MongoDB
- ✅ Schema Explorer works immediately after project creation
- ✅ All table operations (create, update, delete) function correctly

## Version 1.032 - User Profile RLS Policy Implementation
**Release Date**: October 1, 2025

### Major Changes
- **Fixed user profile access issues**: Resolved HTTP 500 errors in `/api/user/profile` endpoint caused by Row Level Security (RLS) policies blocking access to `public.users` table
- **Implemented proper RLS policies**: Added secure, database-level access control without exposing service role keys
- **Enhanced authentication flow**: User profile endpoint now properly authenticates using JWT tokens with RLS compliance

### Bug Fixes
- **PostgreSQL Error PGRST116**: Fixed "Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object" error
  - Root cause: RLS policies were blocking anonymous key access to `public.users` table
  - Solution: Created proper RLS policies allowing authenticated users to access their own profiles
- **User profile data access**: `/api/user/profile` endpoint now successfully retrieves user data from `public.users` table
- **Authentication token handling**: Fixed JWT token extraction and authentication with Supabase client

### Security Improvements
- **Row Level Security Policies Created**:
  - `"Users can view their own profile"`: SELECT policy using `auth.uid() = id` condition
  - `"Users can update their own profile"`: UPDATE policy using `auth.uid() = id` condition  
  - `"Users can insert their own profile"`: INSERT policy using `auth.uid() = id` condition
- **No DELETE permission**: Users cannot delete their own profiles (security by design)
- **Database-level security**: Access control enforced at PostgreSQL level, not application level
- **No service role key exposure**: Avoided using service role key in application code

### Technical Implementation
- **Database Migration**: Applied RLS policies via Supabase migration system
  - Created migration: `setup_users_rls_policies`
  - Dropped conflicting existing policies
  - Granted SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE permissions to `authenticated` role
  - Revoked DELETE permission from `authenticated` role
- **Backend Code Changes** (`apps/backend/main.py`):
  - Added `Request` import for cookie access
  - Modified `/api/user/profile` endpoint to use authenticated Supabase client
  - Implemented JWT token extraction from session cookies
  - Created per-request authenticated Supabase client using `set_session()`
  - Replaced `.single()` with `.execute()` and array indexing for better error handling
  - Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting

### API Endpoints Updated
- **`GET /api/user/profile`**:
  - Now properly authenticated with user's JWT token
  - Returns user profile data: `id`, `email`, `full_name`, `created_at`, `role`
  - Respects RLS policies automatically
  - Provides detailed error messages in development mode

### Files Modified
- `apps/backend/main.py`: Updated user profile endpoint with RLS-compliant authentication
- `apps/backend/setup_users_rls_policies.sql`: Created comprehensive RLS policy setup script
- Database: Applied RLS policies to `public.users` table

### Database Schema Changes
- **Table**: `public.users` (existing table, policies updated)
- **Policies Added**:
  - `Users can view their own profile` (SELECT)
  - `Users can update their own profile` (UPDATE)
  - `Users can insert their own profile` (INSERT)
- **Permissions**: Granted SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE to `authenticated` role
- **Security**: Revoked DELETE permission from `authenticated` role

### Testing & Verification
- ✅ RLS policies successfully applied via migration
- ✅ User profile endpoint returns 200 OK for authenticated users
- ✅ Users can only access their own profile data (RLS enforcement)
- ✅ No service role key exposure in codebase
- ✅ Proper JWT token authentication flow
- ✅ Debug logging shows successful profile lookups

### Security Benefits
- **Database-level protection**: RLS policies enforce security at PostgreSQL level
- **Automatic enforcement**: No application code needed for access control
- **Zero trust architecture**: Each request must be properly authenticated
- **Prevention of data leaks**: Users cannot accidentally access other users' data
- **Service key security**: No exposure of powerful service role keys in application code

## Version 1.0321 - Function Parameter Order Hotfix
**Release Date**: October 1, 2025

### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Python syntax error**: Corrected function parameter order in user profile endpoint
  - Error: `SyntaxError: parameter without a default follows parameter with a default`
  - Location: `/api/user/profile` endpoint function definition
  - Root cause: Incorrect parameter ordering in FastAPI dependency injection
  - Solution: Moved `request: Request` parameter before `user=Depends(get_current_user)`

### Technical Changes
- **Function signature corrected** (`apps/backend/main.py` line 106):
  - Before: `def get_user_profile(user=Depends(get_current_user), request: Request):`
  - After: `def get_user_profile(request: Request, user=Depends(get_current_user)):`
- **Python parameter ordering rules**: Parameters without defaults must precede parameters with defaults
- **FastAPI compatibility**: Maintained proper dependency injection functionality

### Impact
- ✅ Backend server now starts successfully without syntax errors
- ✅ User profile endpoint functionality preserved
- ✅ RLS policies and authentication flow remain intact
- ✅ No breaking changes to API behavior

### Severity
- **Hotfix**: Critical syntax error preventing backend startup
- **Zero functionality impact**: Only corrected Python syntax, no logic changes
- **Immediate deployment**: Ready for production without additional testing

  - Error: `SyncGoTrueClient.set_session() missing 1 required positional argument: 'refresh_token'`
  - Location: `/api/user/profile` endpoint Supabase client authentication
  - Root cause: Incorrect method used for authenticating Supabase client with JWT token
  - Solution: Use `ClientOptions` with Authorization header instead of `set_session()`

### Technical Changes
- **Updated Supabase client authentication** (`apps/backend/main.py`):
  - Removed: `supabase_auth.auth.set_session({"access_token": jwt_token})`
  - Added: Custom `ClientOptions` with Authorization header
  - Implementation: `ClientOptions(headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {jwt_token}"})`
  - Method: Pass JWT token via HTTP Authorization header for RLS authentication

### Code Changes
- **Import additions**:
  - Added `Client` type from `supabase`
  - Added `ClientOptions` from `supabase.lib.client_options`
- **Authentication flow**:
  - Extract JWT token from session cookie
  - Create Supabase client with custom Authorization header
  - RLS policies authenticate user via Bearer token in header
  - Properly scoped access to user's own data

### Impact
- ✅ User profile endpoint now works correctly with RLS policies
- ✅ Proper JWT token authentication without refresh token requirement
- ✅ HTTP header-based authentication (industry standard)
- ✅ Maintains database-level security via RLS
- ✅ No service role key exposure

### Technical Details
- **Authentication Method**: Bearer token in Authorization header
- **RLS Enforcement**: Database validates JWT token via `auth.uid()`
- **Client Scope**: Per-request authenticated client with user context
- **Security Model**: Zero-trust with token validation on every request

### Testing Results
- ✅ Backend imports successfully without errors
- ✅ User profile lookup shows correct user ID
- ✅ JWT token properly extracted from cookies
- ✅ Authorization header correctly formatted
- ✅ Ready for end-to-end testing with frontend

## Version 1.11 - Dialog Positioning Hotfix
**Release Date**: October 1, 2025

### Bug Fix
- **Fixed Dialog Not Appearing**: Resolved Radix UI dialog positioning issue where dialog was rendering but not visible
  - Root cause: CSS transform and positioning classes were not applying correctly due to specificity conflicts
  - Dialog was rendering with `position: static` or off-screen coordinates
  - Tailwind's `translate-x-[-50%]` and `translate-y-[-50%]` classes were being overridden

### Technical Solution
- **Added explicit CSS overrides** in `globals.css` with `!important` flags:
  - `position: fixed` - Ensures dialog floats above content
  - `top: 50%` and `left: 50%` - Centers dialog in viewport
  - `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` - Adjusts for dialog's own dimensions
  - `z-index: 9999` - Ensures dialog appears above all other elements
  - `background: white` - Explicit background color
  - Added proper box-shadow and border-radius for visibility
  - `max-height: 90vh` with `overflow-y: auto` for responsive scrolling

- **Fixed overlay styling**:
  - `z-index: 9998` - Just below dialog
  - `background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)` - Semi-transparent black overlay
  - `position: fixed` with `inset: 0` - Covers entire viewport

- **Simplified dialog component**:
  - Removed conflicting Tailwind classes from DialogContent
  - Let CSS overrides handle all positioning

### Files Modified
- `apps/web/app/globals.css`: Added comprehensive dialog positioning fixes
- `packages/ui/src/dialog.tsx`: Simplified className to avoid conflicts

### Verification
- ✅ Dialog now appears centered on screen when "New project" is clicked
- ✅ Dark overlay appears behind dialog
- ✅ Dialog is scrollable if content exceeds viewport height
- ✅ Dialog closes properly when Cancel or X is clicked
- ✅ Form submission works as expected

- **Default Schema**: "public" schema with sample table
- **Sample Table**: Includes id (PK), name, and created_at columns

### API Behavior
- **GET `/api/v1/projects/{id}/versions/latest`**:
  - Returns 404 if no versions exist
  - Frontend catches 404 and creates initial version
  - Success response includes full dictionary structure

- **POST `/api/v1/projects/{id}/versions`**:
  - Creates version 1 if no versions exist
  - Increments version number automatically
  - Returns created dictionary with version metadata

- **PUT `/api/v1/projects/{id}/versions/{version}`**:
  - Updates existing version's schemas and relationships
  - Used by both Save Changes and Create Schema operations
  - Maintains audit trail with updated_at timestamps

  - Solution: Removed prefix from versions router inclusion in api/v1/__init__.py

- **Fixed Response Format Mismatch**: Updated create_version endpoint to return full dictionary data
  - Frontend expected: `{ data: { dictionary: ... } }`
  - Backend returned: `{ data: { version: ..., dictionary_id: ... } }`
  - Solution: Modified response to include full dictionary object as expected by frontend

- **Fixed HTTP Method Mismatch**: Changed update_version endpoint from PATCH to PUT
  - Frontend uses PUT method for updating versions
  - Backend was configured with PATCH method
  - Solution: Changed decorator from `@router.patch` to `@router.put`

### Technical Changes
- **API Router Configuration** (`/apps/backend/api/v1/__init__.py`):
